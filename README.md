Version History
================

__v1.0.3__

* Initial release

Introduction
============

Infrastructure templates and utilities for building AWS CloudFormation stacks. Respawn uses [cfn-pyplates](https://cfn-pyplates.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) to generate CloudFormation templates. Respawn digests a custom, easy to read/write YAML representation of a JSON CloudFormation template and resources, with the goal of generating CloudFormation templates based on python templates (pyplates!) that reflect the CloudFormation template hierarchy.

Respawn is a Python package that provides interfaces to Amazon Web Services - Cloudformation. It allows for easier and more user friendly and concise YAML keywords to create resources/parameters/userdata in CloudFormation stacks. This is used in Dow Jones [professional information business](http://www.dowjones.com) pipeline and with success and has been modified to be as generic and serve all. Currently the library supports Python 2.7.
